I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my __________
I trade my ._________ for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a __________
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way
Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, ._________ was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just __________ you, 
and this is crazy
But here's my ._________
So __________ me maybe 
It's hard to look right
At you ._________
But here's my number
So call me maybe
Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my __________
So ._________ me maybe
And all the other boys
Try to __________ me
But here's my number
So call me maybe
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the ._________
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my __________
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel ._________
But it's in my way
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, __________ was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're ._________ baby
Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my __________
So ._________ me maybe
It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my __________
So ._________ me maybe
Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me maybe
And all the other boys
Try to __________ me
But here's my ._________
So call me maybe
Before you came into my __________
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so ._________
Before you came into my life
I __________ you so bad
And you should know that
I ._________ you so, so bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my __________
So ._________ me maybe
Hey, I just __________ you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me maybe
And all the other boys
Try to ._________ me
But here's my number
So call me maybe
Before you __________ into my ._________
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
So __________ me ._________
